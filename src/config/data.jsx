    subText:'01. A PORTFOLIO IS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER DESIGN PROJECT \n A common mistake in portfolio building is to “let the work speak for itself.” But a good portfolio is more than just a showcase of your past work. Your portfolio as a whole should culminate in an experience that tells a story, just like any other of your design projects. When designing your online portfolio, remember that your website is often your visitors’ first impression of you and your work. Go for an engaging and sophisticated website that speaks volumes about your design skills by applying your web design capabilities and personal sense of style. \n \n 02. IT’S ALL ABOUT THE PRESENTATION  \n Rather than uploading a few exported files, bring your work to life with visuals that show the bigger picture. Take the time to set up a photoshoot of your projects. This is especially relevant for industrial design portfolios, but is also good practice for illustrations and other graphic design works. Think of your color palette, props, and settings by creating interesting pictures that capture the essence of your work. \n \n 03. QUALITY OVER QUANTITY \n Cramming everything you’ve ever done into your personal portfolio may be tempting, but most employers would advise you against it. Pick only your absolute best pieces to show, trusting them to shine bright and impress site visitors. We recommend no more than a total of six to ten projects. Showcasing a limited amount of projects allows you to present each one thoroughly, including all the relevant details and clearly explaining their backstory. Go beyond finished pieces alone by creating casestudies, walking visitors through your design process – from the initial objective to the final results. While this is especially common in UX designer’s portfolios, it could also be beneficial in other areas of design. You can include work-in-progress pics, preliminary drafts or anything else that can contextualize the work and add to your visitors’ understanding of the project. \n \n 04. BUILD A WEBSITE THAT’S EASY TO MAINTAIN \n Your portfolio website is meant to stay with you for the long run, and you don’t want to start it from scratch every couple of years. On the other hand, you also need to keep it fresh with new content and styles every once in a while, to best reflect your creative development. Build an online portfolio that’ll be easy to get back to for updates and revisions down the line. Make your portfolio website easy tomaintain by saving your font and color themes, your page layouts and other presets. \n \n 05. DON’T OVERLOOK WRITTEN COPY  \n Text is just as much a part of your portfolio as are your visuals. Expertly craft the written copy on your portfolioin order to amplify your message, keeping your writing style in tune with the general vibe of your site. Don’t forget to double check for spelling mistakes and typos, ensuring a professional and presentable website. As for the text itself, be sure to add your name and specialty straight on the top fold of your homepage. This way, visitors will know who you are and what you do immediately upon entering the site. For each of your project pages, add a title and a short textual description that explains the reasoning behind your design and puts it into context. \n \n 06. GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE  \n Acknowledging the hard work of everyone involved in your projects by giving them their well-deserved credit is a common courtesy you shouldn’t neglect. And from a less altruistic standpoint, it highlights the fact that you’re a great team player. Make sure to mention by name those who helped make your work possible in collaborative projects, and add photo credits for pictures that you didn’t take. Additionally, explain what your part was in projects where your contribution was more limited. Remember that it doesn’t detract from your role in the project – it simply explains it better. \n \n 07. GET FOUND ON GOOGLE SEARCH RESULTS \n Your beautiful work deserves to be seen online – and the best way to go about it is by upping your SEO game (or ‘Search Engine Optimization’). By following a set of simple rules, you can work towards improving your design portfolio’s ranking on Google search results. Some of the best practices for improving your portfolio’s SEO are filling in metadata for your images and pages, choosing a good domain name, and making sure you use strategic keywords that Google will associate with your site. We recommend consulting with the webtrickerfor a free personalized SEO plan.',

    title: 'How to Write Content For Amazon Affiliate Site That Converts',
    titleDesc:"“So, tell me about yourself,” said the blank screen to the designer embarking on their portfolio website. Indeed, creating an online portfolio comes with its share of big life questions. It’s your chance to tell the world who you are as a creative, delving into your projects, passions, experiences, and expertise - so the stakes are high for getting it right. Not to mention, it’s what gets you hired (or commissioned).",
    subText:'01. BEFORE WRITING \n There are two ways to write about products. The first way is buying a product for your own and then use it to know its performance. This way is more trusted and reliable to the people and you can also explain everything easily to them. But it is not always possible to buy products for testing purpose. In that case, you can help from the product pages of the products. You can know about the products from the products pages. The information you will get from the page will help you to know the features and specifications of a product. There is another helpful thing which is ‘Customer Review’ section. You can know about the actual performance people get after using the product there. That will help you to understand which one is really helpful for the users and you can include the items on your website then. \n \n 02. BUYING GUIDE/HOW TO TYPE ARTICLE \n For these types of article, you can write the ways to choose the best product in a specific category. Sometimes people also want to know how to use a gadget, tools, or anything that they buy. Especially the beginner always looks for how to use a product. In order to write a buying guide for a product, you have to research over some items. You can point out what are the common and most useful features they provide. When you will know about the common and useful facts of the products, you can tell the readers to consider the facts carefully. \n \n 03. LET’S TALK ABOUT ARTICLE \n Everybody says that content is king for a website. There are some reasons behind that. As we said already there is no way to talk directly with the readers, you have to convince them through what the content. In that case, one of the most important things is the article. For an amazon affiliate website, you have to put two types of articles. One is ‘Buying guide/How to’ types and another one is ‘Money Article/Money Content’. \n \n 04. PRODUCT REVIEW TYPE ARTICLE \n First of all, you have to choose the best products to write a review article. Choose the product which is easy to use and be sure that users will get most of the features as like as they expect. It is also very important to have sufficient facilities for servicing (for the tools). Before you start writing about a product, be prepared to spend sufficient time for research. Knowing the information from the product page is not enough to write a good product review. Suppose, you are going to write a product review for a niche site. In that case, you must write about 500-1000 words for each product. Try to write an engaging review. Don’t make the review larger with unnecessary words. If you so that, your article will not engage. As a result, you will get no benefit from there. So, make sufficient research over the product you are going to write about. Be sure that you are not telling about the product features only. Telling about the benefits is more important. You have to tell them the reasons for buying the product you are promoting. An interesting fact is, telling the features and benefits are not so enough to convince a customer. You have to confirm the customer that if they face any problem after buying or while using the product, there are sufficient solutions. Otherwise, they can be distracted by the product. \n \n 05. HOW SHOULD BE AN ARTICLE? \n Make it easy to the reader. You can use the words which are easy to understand. Remember that, easier the article means more chances to convert. Try to write the product with short sentences so that it will easy to understand. Writing a lot of words that people can’t understand properly is totally waste of your time. Make easy whatever you write. Remember that, you are not writing a Medical or Engineering book. Try to avoid the grammatical mistake which is a big issue. Grammar mistake will be a great disturbance while doing SEO. That will decrease the value of your article as well.',

    titleDesc:"When people visit your website, you can’t directly talk to them.",
    subText:'01. What is pay-per-click marketing? \n How does PPC advertising increase sales? 5 reasons you would like to do PPC marketing immediately 3 steps to urging Getting Started with PPC Advertising Design a winning pay-per-click advertising strategy WHAT IS PAY-PER-CLICK MARKETING?. MARKETING PPC. To understand the model, let’s look at a brief history of PPC services. The platform that pioneered the pay-per-click model in 1996 can be a web directory called Planet Oasis. They charged companies for displaying their name and website link in a virtual city; the “buildings” on the central page cost more and additional fees were charged for each click. \n \n 02. HOW DOES PPC ADVERTISING BOOST SALES?. \n If you ask any leading PPC advertising agency why online advertising is effective, they are likely to use ads on billboards as a comparison measure. Many will see your ad on billboards, but you don’t have the skills you need, many of them belong to your target market, or how effective it has been to grow your customer base. This is often very relevant because people don’t go out as often and are less likely to find out about your ad. With online PPC services, you have a lot of control over the performance of your campaign due to data collection. Deliver your ad to a selected audience and make sure it reaches them correctly. Through views and clicks, you’ll determine how appealing your ad is and make changes to improve campaign performance. Most importantly, you’ll determine who clicked to make a sale by using advanced tracking and analysis tools. \n \n 03. 5 REASONS YOU’DLIKE TO DO PPC MARKETING IMMEDIATELY. \n A slowing economy leads everyone to meticulously assess spending priorities. But your company’s need for brand visibility is always present. A Forbes article about advertising during a recession shares: “When times are good, it should be advertised, when times are bad, you want to advertise.” 28 percent growth in Amazon’s sales during the 2009 recession may be a testament to the present. A remarkable Harvard Business Review study tells us that in history, a progressive strategy of reorienting spending (in the face of drastic cuts) during a recession benefits businesses after the recession and, therefore, the correct formula allowed 9 percent of companies to return stronger. \n \n 04. HERE ARE THE MAIN REASONS WHY INVESTING IN PPC MARKETING IS RIGHT NOW: \n 1. SEE THE RESULTS QUICKLY. The need is now and you would like a quick shot into your arm to overcome prolonged downtime. Realistically, simple ads are often created and approved within 24 to 48 hours. And if done correctly, your ad can generate profitable results from day one. \n 2. MOST ARE ONLINE. The recent health crisis forced limitations on physical interaction and pushed brands to make a web presence or strengthen their attraction. With everything available online, from basic work and faculty, your audience spends more time in front of the screen than ever before, expanding your lead group. \n 3. COST PER CLICK HAS DROPPED. An economic slowdown creates a buyer’s market for advertisers. Costs per click (CPC) went down and at one point decreased by six percent across all verticals. With increasingly cheaper CPC offerings, you save more on your advertising budget and get higher returns. \n 4. YOUR COMPETITORS ARE LESS VISIBLE. Cost reduction across industries has made great players less visible, leaving a space for more brands to look. WebtrickerPPC manager John Powell shares that companies can capture traffic and conversions because of this reduced competition. It is an excellent opportunity to make yourself noticed online, especially for new PPC companies. \n \n 05. GET STARTED WITH PPC ADVERTISING \n If a pay-per-click agency promises a particular return on investment (ROI), you should consider it. While there are proven techniques that make PPC strategies effective, there is no magic formula that produces a guaranteed result. Strategic planning and continuous development are needed to make it work.',
